# Status Update 

---

Have had a couple rough months with family passing, so haven't touched my code for a while. 

Have had to restudy my existing code (taught me a lot about the importance of efficient variable/module naming, lol!), will be starting back work soon. 

## Current workings in the lineup:

- Trying to refactor addTask and editTask modules into one createTask module combining the functions of each, thereby reducing redundancy and following DRY
- Thinking of a way to add whatever the current form data is to the overall setStorage, so as to avoid editTask having to awkwardly gather it from the form each time
- Prioritize creating a "Delete" button to each task/todo, so as to more easily test the program without having to manually delete it in the console each time
- Restudy and workout kinks with "date-fns"
